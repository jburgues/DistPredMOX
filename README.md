Wind tunnel facility used in the experiments

We have experimentally demonstrated that, in a wind tunnel facility and assuming the same constant emission rate, a low-pass differentiator filter with optimized parameters can exploit transient features of gas sensor signals to predict the gas source distance with high accuracy. The proposed algorithm significantly reduces the prediction error, as compared to previously reported algorithms.
